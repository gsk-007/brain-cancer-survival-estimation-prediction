# DS AI - Brain Cancer Patients Survival Estimation

## Introduction

Brain cancer is a complex and challenging disease with significant variations in patient outcomes. Predicting the survival of brain cancer patients plays a crucial role in clinical decision-making, treatment planning, and personalized patient care. With advancements in data science and artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for survival estimation in brain cancer patients.

This project focuses on applying advanced machine learning methods to develop predictive models for brain cancer patient survival estimation. By leveraging large-scale clinical datasets, genomic data, and medical imaging data, we aim to create accurate and reliable models that can assist healthcare professionals in predicting patient outcomes.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Gather and preprocess relevant clinical data, genomic data, and medical imaging data of brain cancer patients.
2. Explore and analyze the data to gain insights into the factors influencing patient survival.
3. Develop and train advanced machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models, to predict survival outcomes.
4. Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
5. Investigate feature importance and interpretability of the models to identify key factors contributing to patient survival.
6. Provide insights and recommendations to healthcare professionals to aid in treatment planning and decision-making for brain cancer patients.

By achieving these objectives, we aim to contribute to the field of precision medicine by providing accurate survival estimates for brain cancer patients, which can potentially lead to improved patient care and treatment outcomes.
